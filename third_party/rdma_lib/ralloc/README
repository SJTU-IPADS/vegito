This is a malloc for memory allocation in RDMA register area.
It is extended from ssmalloc, thus it is as efficient as ssmalloc.
Notice that using this lib will also overlap the malloc implementation.
We will fix this later but strongly recommand u to use this malloc since it is more efficient in multi-thread programming.

Current limitation:
If the allocation size is large than 128K, then this malloc will use huge malloc. The memory alloced by huge malloc will
never be reclaimed, thus the user must mange this him/herself.
Usually we found that if the memory allocation is very large, it is never freed through the application lifecycle, so maye
this is not a problem.

Install:
make;make install;
And linked the libraries generated in ../lib directory. 

Following is the original README from ssmalloc. 

SSMalloc
========

 SSMalloc is a low-latency, locality-conscious memory 
 allocator with stable performance scalability. 


Compilation & Install
=====================

 SSMalloc requires libtool for compilation.
 In the SSMalloc directory, type:

 $ make
 $ make install


Usage
=====
 Use libssmalloc.a for static linking. If you want to 
 dynamically link SSMalloc into your program. Please 
 set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable as below.

 $export LD_PRELOAD=(path)/libssmalloc.so
